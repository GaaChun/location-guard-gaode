### Please read the FAQ before opening an issue

https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard#why-some-websites-detect-my-location-although-i-use-location-guard

In particular, note that Location Guard protects against JavaScript-based and not IP-based geolocation.

### Test Location Guard on browserleaks.com

https://browserleaks.com/geo

If the issue does not appear on browserleaks.com, but appears on some other website, that website is likely using IP-based or some other form of geolocation. Location Guard is not supposed to protect against other types of geolocation.
